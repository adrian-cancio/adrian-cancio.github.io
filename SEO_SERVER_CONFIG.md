# Server-Side SEO Configuration Guide

This document covers SEO improvements that require server or hosting configuration outside the repository.

## ‚úÖ Content & Internal Linking (Completed)

The following improvements have been implemented in the repository:

- **Homepage word count**: Expanded from ~420 to ~800+ words
- **H1 length**: Increased from 13 to 37 characters with keywords ("Adrian Cancio - Cloud DevOps Engineer")
- **Internal links**: Increased from 7 to 25+ contextual internal links
- **Content quality**: Added detailed sections on development philosophy, approach, and expanded project descriptions
- **Social meta tags**: Already implemented in layout.tsx (Open Graph and Twitter cards)

## ‚è≥ HTTPS Redirect Configuration (Server-Side)

### Current Status
The site needs proper HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS 301 redirects configured at the server/CDN level.

### Implementation Steps

#### For GitHub Pages (Current Hosting)

1. **Verify HTTPS Enforcement**
   - Navigate to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Ensure "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox is enabled
   - GitHub Pages should automatically redirect HTTP to HTTPS

2. **Test the Redirect**
   ```bash
   # Should return 301 redirect to HTTPS
   curl -I http://adrian.cancio.info
   
   # Expected response headers:
   # HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
   # Location: https://adrian.cancio.info/
   ```

3. **Verify All Variants**
   Test these URLs to ensure they all redirect to the canonical HTTPS version:
   - http://adrian.cancio.info ‚Üí https://adrian.cancio.info
   - http://www.adrian.cancio.info ‚Üí https://adrian.cancio.info (if www is configured)
   - https://www.adrian.cancio.info ‚Üí https://adrian.cancio.info (if www is configured)

#### For Custom CDN (Optional)

If you migrate to a CDN like Cloudflare, Fastly, or AWS CloudFront:

1. **Cloudflare**
   - Enable "Always Use HTTPS" in SSL/TLS ‚Üí Edge Certificates
   - Set up "Automatic HTTPS Rewrites"
   - Create Page Rules for www ‚Üí non-www redirects if needed

2. **AWS CloudFront**
   - Configure viewer protocol policy to "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS"
   - Set up Lambda@Edge for www redirects if needed

3. **Nginx (Self-Hosted)**
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name adrian.cancio.info www.adrian.cancio.info;
       return 301 https://adrian.cancio.info$request_uri;
   }
   
   server {
       listen 443 ssl http2;
       server_name www.adrian.cancio.info;
       return 301 https://adrian.cancio.info$request_uri;
   }
   ```
