## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to explore the site. The app supports hot module reloading for rapid iteration.

## Quality Gates

Run linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Run the unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server (after building):

```bash
npm run start
```

## Deployment

The project is configured for static export (`output: "export"` in `next.config.ts`), producing assets under `out/` when you run `npm run build`.

### GitHub Pages via Actions (recommended)
1. Ensure GitHub Pages is set to ‚ÄúGitHub Actions‚Äù in the repository settings.
2. Push to `master`. The workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will:
	- Install dependencies
	- Run linting and tests
	- Build the static site
	- Publish the `out/` directory to GitHub Pages
3. Once the workflow completes, your site will be available at https://adrian-cancio.github.io/.

### Manual export (optional)

```bash
npm run build
```

The static assets live in `out/`. Deploy that folder to any static host if you prefer an alternative platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages).
